# Dashboard

The dashboard is where information and actions specific to you are easiest to find.  In addition to the tabs covered below, the dashboard will also display alerts and notifications.  For example if you've been added to a new group you'll see a notification for that; if you have a pending COI disclosure you'll see an alert for that, too.

## Groups Tab
If you're an active member of a group, you'll see it in your groups list.  Click on the group's row to go to it's detail screen.

## Your Info
Your profile and demographic information is listed here.

You can edit your information by clicking the edit button ![edit button](/images/edit-button.png) in the upper right corner.

Editing should be straightforward, but there are a couple of things to note:
1. The institution field is a search-as-you-type input.  Start typing the name of your institution and it will show those that match.  If your institution does not show up please contact support to have it added.  (we'll let you add institutions on your own soon.)
2. Timezone is a trickier thing that you might think and is captured by your region and "closest" city.  To select your timezone select your region first and you can then select you city from the city dropdown.

### Demographics
We collect demographic data to help our efforts to ensure that ClinGen is made of a diverse group of people and for grant reporting purposes.  We understand identity is a complex and nuanced issue and that the options in these dropdowns may not represent how you identify.  Please select what seems most correct for you.  If you have concerns please contact us.

## COIs
All of your latest conflict of interest disclosures will be listed here, as well as links to any that are currently outstanding.

You can view a COI disclosure by clicking the 'View response' button.

To update your disclosure by clicking the 'Update COI' button.
