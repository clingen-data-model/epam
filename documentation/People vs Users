In the GPM we have Users and People.  Users can log in. People are records of individuals that are part of ClinGen.  The system was designed to allow people to exist without ever activating a User account.  Most People also have a User Account.  A common case where a user account doesn't exist is if the person doesn't accept their invitation to join ClinGen.  

The distinction between Users and People is important in how deletions are handled.  

Person records can be soft-deleted.  We add a timestamp to the `deleted_at` column in the database so the application knows they are effectively deleted.

User records are always hard-deleted.  The record is completely removed from the database.

To “hard” delete a record:

1. Go into the artisan console in one of the containers `php artisan tinker` 
2. Loading up the record.  For example: `$ebony = Person::withTrashed()->find(2547)`
3. Hard deleting them.  For example:  `$ebony->forceDelete()`

You could also restore the soft-deleted record by following steps 1 & 2 above, then `$ebony->restore()`

Needed enhancements to this process are to make people deletion more visible: 

1. Update the People list view to allow the user to include/exclude/only-show deleted people
2. Update the Person detail screen to show soft-deleted people and allow admins to hard-delete people
