# Applications

**Applications** are currently relevant to GCEPS and VCEPS.

Applications are dived into **steps** with each step divided into **sections**.  GCEPS currently only have one step, while VCEP applications have four steps.

Each section may have 0 or more **requirements** that must be met before the system will allow the section to be submitted. For example the Members section has a requirement that members must represent at least three different institutions.

Applications may have zero or more **Submissions**. A submission is a record of step being submitted for review.

### Planned for V3 ###
Applications may have zero or more **Comments**.  These are text comments made by pre-approvers and approvers for internal communication.  They will never be shared with the group that is applying.

Applications may have zero or more **Revision requests**.  A revision request is a comment that will be shared with the EP indicating a requested revision to the application.  RevisionRequests are "anchored" to a section.

Revision requests can have zero or more **resonses**.  A response is a textual response to the revision request from EP that is applying.
