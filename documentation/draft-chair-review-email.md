Hi folks,

Because it's proving difficult to get y'all in the same "place" at the same time we thought we could demo application approval workflow and get your feedback asynchronously.

I've recorded a screen-cast that walks you through the approval workflow features we've built. You can watch that here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CygwCDGXtg-qqAe8RYO8TCqeIecGtpW/view?usp=sharing.  There is one correction to the video: 
* The GPM will send you email about both when an applications "sent to chairs for approval" AND Monday morning if there are applications that are waiting for your response.
And one item I'd like to point out that's not covered in the video:
* We've added a publication count (from PubMed) to each chair and expert in the expert panel.  Clicking that count will take you to a search for that person in PubMed so you can get more details about their publication. You can also click a button to get a publication count for coordinators and curators. 

Emma has put together an SOP document for your part of the approval workflow.  You can refer to that here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LcCnwcYE1xLweIA1cuJbWoKgqm3zPrVZrdECoqhdQTA.

Also, If you'd like to see the workflow in action, you can visit the GPM demo system and try it out yourself. The GPM demo system is here: https://gpm-demo.apps.cloudapps.unc.edu.  You can log into the demo system with the same username/password you use for the production system.  We've set up a couple applications with which you can try out the features.  Please let me know if you run into any problems in the demo system.

We're excited to get your feedback and answer your questions about the approval workflow.  I'm happy take your questions and feedback publicly or privately via email, slack, or on a call.  Whatever works best for you is good for me. 

Thanks!
TJ
