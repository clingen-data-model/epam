# Approval Workflow Walkthrough
Hi.  Because it's hard to find a time when everyone is available and we want to keep moving forward we thought we'd give you an overview of the approval workflow and get your feedback this way.

## Concepts
First I'd like to review a couple core concepts and establish some vocab:
* Submission: A submission is a record of an application (and/or update in the future) having been submitted.  It also tracks the response to that submission.
  * Submissions can have one of a few statuses:
    1. Pending
    2. Under Chair Review
    3. Revisions Requested
    4. Approved
* Judgement: Your verdict on a submission. You can approve, approve-after-revisions, or require-revisions.  You can also add additional notes for the EP.
* Comments: Comments are notes about the application.
  * Users with commenting privileges can see, create, update, delete, resolve, and reply to comments.  Most users can only update/delete their 
  * Comments are connected to an ExpertPanel/Application at a given application step, not a submission.  That way they stick around across multiple submissions of the same step.
  * Comments are one of three types: 
    1. **Internal Comment**: these are only ever shown to users with commenting privileges, i.e. Core Group members, Emma, me, and you.
    2. **Suggestion**: These comments will be shown to the EP leadership (chairs & coordinators).  They are comments for consideration, but do not require action for the EP Application to be approved.
    3. **Required Revision**: These are shared with the EP leadership and must be resolved before the EP Application will be approved.
   * Comments can be marked "Resolved" to keep track of issues that are no longer relevant.  Resolved "suggestions" and "requested revisions" will no longer be shared with the EP leadership.

## Before it gets to you...
Now that we've covered some core concepts I'd like to give you a quick overview of how the Core Group (or Emma) will use the GPM to respond to submissions.

1. First an EP needs to submit their application.  When this happens the GPM sends an email to the appropriate Core Group to let them know.
2. When a core group member (or Emma) logs into the GPM, they will see the *Application Activity* dashboard.
    * This dashboard lists all of the applications that have started down the approval process but haven't been approved yet.
3. A core group member (or Emma) can then go to an application, review and add comments.
4. When they're ready the core group (or emma) can "Send to Chairs for Review".  When they do, the GPM will send you an email letting your know that an application is ready for your review.

## Where you come in
Now that an application has been sent to you for approval you can log into the GPM and see the "Application Activity" dashboard.

Your Application activity dashboard only lists the applications that require your attention.  You can click the row or the "review" button to got to the application's review screen.

At the top of this screen you'll see:
 * A summary of the comments added by the core group
 * Additional notes added by the core group about this submission (if any)
 * And a button to approve or request revisions.

Below the "Approval Block" you'll find each of the application sections. On the left 3/4 of the screen is the EPs information.  On the right 1/4 you'll see comments related to that section.

### commenting
To add a comment related a section click the 'Add comment' button in that section.  The comment form will appear and you can select the type of comment and write whatever you'd like.

You can also reply to a comment by clicking the 'Reply' link.  All replies are treated as internal comments so you don't have to select the type.

For your comments you can also update, delete and "resolve".  Click the ellipsis in the upper right hand corner of the comment to display list of options.
  * 'Edit' will show the comment edit form.
  * 'Resolve' will mark the comment as resolved.
  * 'Delete' will confirm that you want to delete, and if so remove the comment completely.

Once you've completed reviewing the application and making your comments you can return to the top of the screen and click the 'Approve or request revisions' button.

A dialog will open up and show you the comments that will be shared with the expert panel (i.e. unresolved suggestions and revisions), and allow you to make your decision. 

You can:
  1. Request revisions: You want the EP to make the revisions indicated AND you want to review those revisions before approving the applications.
  2. Approve after revisions: You want the EP to make the required-revisions, but once the Core Group (or Emma) can verify those revisions have been made you approve.  As far as the GPM is concerned this is the same as requesting revisions, but it gives the Core Group/Emma the information they need to move forward without you having to review the revisions.
  3. Approve: You are ready to approve this application as is, regardless of any suggestions or required-revisions that may be listed.

You can also add any additional notes you would like to send to the expert panel.  These notes, like the suggestions and required-revisions, will show up in the draft email that will be sent to the EP.

Once you've made your decision you can change it by clicking 'Change Decision' or cancel it all together if you'd like to reconsider.

## After your decision
After you've made your decision Core Group members/Emma will see an indication of your response in the Application activity dashboard and details about your decision on the application admin screen.

When the Core Group is ready to share your decision with the EP they can then approve or request revisions.
  * If revisions are requested the GPM will present a draft email including the un-resolved suggestions, requested-revisions and notes from you.  The Core Group member/Emma can then edit those comments before finally sending the email.

At this point the application is either approved or back in the court of the EP to make the requested revisions and re-submit.
