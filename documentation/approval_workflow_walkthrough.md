# Approval Workflow Walkthrough
Hi, TJ here.  I'd like to give you an overview of the application approval workflow.  In particular, I want to walk you through your experience as appovers in this workflow.

## Concepts
Before we get started, let's review a few core concepts and establish some vocabulary:
* A **submission** is a record of an application having been submitted.  It also tracks the response to that submission.
  * Submissions can have one of a few statuses:
    1. The Pending status indicates that the application has been submitted and no action administrative action has yet been taken.
    2. The Under Chair Review status indicates that the application has been sent to the CDWG OC Chairs for review.  
    3. The Revisions Requested status indicates that the core group and chairs have decided that revisions are needed before the application can be approved.
    4. The Approved status is just what it sounds like: the submission and thus application have been approved..
* A **Judgement** is a verdict on a submission by an approver. You can approve, approve-after-revisions, or require-revisions.  You can also add additional notes for the EP. We'll talk about this in more detail in a minute.
* **Comments** are notes about the application.
  * Users with commenting privileges can see, create, update, delete, resolve, and reply to comments.  Most users can only update/delete comments they have made.
  * Comments are connected to an ExpertPanel/Application at a given application step, not a submission.  That way they stick around across multiple submissions of the same step.
  * Comments are one of three types: 
    1. **Internal Comment** are only ever shown to users with commenting privileges, i.e. Core Group members, Emma, me, and you.
    2. **Suggestion** will be shown to the EP leadership (chairs & coordinators).  They are comments for consideration, but do not require action for the EP Application will be approved.
    3. **Required Revision** are shared with the EP leadership and must be resolved before the Application will be approved.
   * Comments can be marked "Resolved" to keep track of issues that are no longer relevant.  Resolved "suggestions" and "requested revisions" will no longer be shared with the EP leadership.

## Before it gets to you...
Now that we've covered some core concepts I'd like to give you a quick overview of how the Core Group will use the GPM to respond to submissions.

1. First an EP needs to submit their application.  When this happens the GPM: 
    * Sends an email to the appropriate Core Group to let them know
    * Creates a snapshot of the application.  We don't currently do anything with these snapshots, but they're there in case we need them.
2. When a core group member logs into the GPM, they will see the *Application Activity* dashboard.
    * This dashboard lists all of the applications that have started down the approval process but haven't been approved yet.
3. A core group member can then visit an application, review, and add comments.
4. When they're ready, the core group can "Send to Chairs for Review".  When a submission is sent to the chairs it will be included in weekly emails to you if you have not yet given a judgement.  Emails will only be sent there is one or more EP application submissions that require your attention.

## Where you come in
Now that an application has been sent to you for approval, you can log into the GPM and see the "Application Activity" dashboard.

Your Application activity dashboard only lists the applications that require your attention.  You can click the row or the "review" button to got to the application's review screen.

At the top of this screen you'll see:
 * A summary of the comments added by the core group
 * Additional notes added by the core group about this submission (if any)
 * And a button to approve or request revisions.

Below the "Approval Block" you'll find each of the application sections. On the left 3/4 of the screen is the EPs information.  On the right 1/4 you'll see comments related to that section.

### commenting
To add a comment related to a section click the 'Add comment' button in that section.  
The comment form will appear and you can select the type of comment and write whatever you'd like.

You can also reply to a comment by clicking the 'Reply' link.  
All replies are treated as internal comments so you don't have to select the type.

For your comments you can also update, delete and "resolve".  
Click the ellipsis in the upper right hand corner of the comment to display list of options.
  * 'Edit' will show the edit form.
  * 'Resolve' will mark the comment as resolved.
  * 'Delete' will confirm that you want to delete, and if so remove the comment completely.

Once you've finished reviewing the application and making your comments, you can return to the top of the screen and click the 'Approve or request revisions' button.

A dialog will open up and show you the comments that will be shared with the expert panel (i.e. unresolved suggestions and revisions), and allow you to make your judgment. 

You can **Request revisions**, meaning you want the EP to make the revisions indicated AND you want to review those revisions before approving the application.
You can **Approve after revisions**, indicating that You want the EP to make the required-revisions, but once the Core Group can verify those revisions have been made, you approve.  As far as the GPM is concerned this is the same as requesting revisions, but it gives the Core Group the information they need to move forward.
Finally, you can Approve the application regardless of any suggestions or required-revisions that may be listed.

You can also add any additional notes you'd like to convey to the expert panel.  
These notes, like the suggestions and required-revisions, will show up in the draft email that will be sent to the EP.

Once you've made your judgment you can change it by clicking 'Change Decision'...
or you may cancel it all together if you'd like to reconsider.

## After your decision
Once you've made your judgement Core Group members will see an indication of your response in the Application activity dashboard. Details about your decision are displayed on the application admin screen.

When the Core Group is ready to share your decision with the EP they can then "approve" or "request revisions".
  * Clicking *approve* will present a draft email with the unresolved suggestions and any additional notes your added for the EP.
  * When revisions are requested, the GPM will present a draft email including the un-resolved suggestions, requested-revisions and notes from you.  The Core Group member can then edit those comments before finally sending the email.

At this point the application is either approved or back in the court of the EP to make the requested revisions and re-submit.


Thanks for taking the time to watch this walk through.  We look forward to answering any questions you might have and hearing your feedback.
