### How will my profile information be used?

In the near term, your profile information will be used internally by your group coordinators and by ClinGen to do analytics and create reports.

In the longer term the following data from your profile may be shared with [www.clinicalgenome.org](http://www.clinicalgenome.org) to keep published data up to date:

- Name
- Institution
- Profile Photo (coming soon)
- Credentials
- Biography
- Primary Occupation


### How often will the GPM send me an email?

The GPM currently sends email to all users for the following reasons:

- You are invited you activate your account. This only happens once.
- You have been added to a group. This will happen once for each group of which you become a member.
- You have outstanding Conflict of Interest Disclosures that need to be completed. COI disclosures must be completed when you join an expert panel; they must be updated every 12 months after that. The GPM will send reminders every week.
