Reach out to the coordinator of that Expert Panel in order to add or remove you from that EP’s roster.


### How often will the GPM send me an email?

The GPM currently sends email to all users for the following reasons:

- You are invited to activate your account. This only happens once.
- You have been added to a group. This will happen once for each group of which you become a member.
- You have outstanding Conflict of Interest Disclosures that need to be completed. COI disclosures must be completed when you join an expert panel; they must be updated every 12 months after that. The GPM will send reminders every week.
